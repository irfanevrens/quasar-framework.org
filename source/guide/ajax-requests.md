title: Ajax Requests
---
Quasar recommends using `Vue Resource` plugin for VueJs or `Axios`. These package are not provided by default so you will have to npm install them and import them from `src/main.js`.

Get started with the documentation for [vue-resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource) or [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios).
